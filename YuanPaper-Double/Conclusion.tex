\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we proposed a Distributed Energy-Aware Load Balancing Routing Algorithm for LEO satellite network. Considering the energy is essential in the satellite networks. According to DEAL, the charging and discharging rate in LEO satellite batteries decrease, as it translates directly into cost savings. Furthermore, DEAL considers not only energy but also congestion level and ISL instability. The performance has been evaluated considering packet delivery ratio, occupying ratio of buffer queues, end-to-end delay, link utilization, and the remaining energy of satellites. Compared with the SPF algorithm, DEAL can achieve a better packet delivery ratio, load balancing, and system lifetime.
