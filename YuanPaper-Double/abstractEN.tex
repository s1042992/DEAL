With the rise of network traffic demand, low-latency LEO satellite networks have become more popular.  The period of the satellite orbit can be divided into two: the sunlight period and the eclipse period. In the eclipse period, the satellite is only powered by its battery. Overusing a battery will lead to a high depth of discharge(DoD), which will lead to a shorter lifetime of the battery.  In Distributed Energy-Aware Load Balancing Routing Algorithm for LEO Satellite Network(DEAL), we proposed a method to estimate the remaining energy level of the neighbor satellite with little information demanded. Furthermore, DEAL also considers load balance.  DEAL can choose two shortest-path neighbors as the next hop, splitting the traffic flow into two by the status of the neighbor, and the status includes remaining energy, congestion level, and instability of ISL. We evaluated our algorithms by simulations on LEO satellite network with real Internet usage traces. The results showed DEAL can prolong the lifetime of the satellite battery, achieve a small occupying ratio of buffer queue, and a small link utilization ratio.
